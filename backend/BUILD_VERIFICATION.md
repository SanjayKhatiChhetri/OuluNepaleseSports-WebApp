# Build Verification - Authentication Implementation

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS

The WorkOS authentication integration has been successfully implemented and all TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved.

### 🔧 Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: TypeScript error in `src/services/jwt.ts` - JWT_SECRET type assertion
- **Solution**: Added proper type assertions with `as string` and non-null assertion operator `!`
