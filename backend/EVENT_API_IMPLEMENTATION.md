# Event Management API Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Event Management API as specified in task 4.2.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Event Service (`src/services/event.ts`)
- **getEvents()**: Retrieve events with filtering (date range, location, registration status) and pagination
- **getEventById()**: Get specific event with full details including registrations and media
- **createEvent()**: Create new event with content and event-specific data
- **updateEvent()**: Update existing event with permission checks
- **deleteEvent()**: Delete event (cascades to related data)
- **registerForEvent()**: Handle event registration with validation and business logic
- **getEventRegistrations()**: Retrieve event registrations with pagination
- **getPublishedEvents()**: Get published events for public access

### 2. Event Controller (`src/controllers/event.ts`)
- **getEvents**: GET /api/events - List events with filtering and pagination
- **getEventById**: GET /api/events/:id - Get specific event details
- **createEvent**: POST /api/events - Create new event (auth required)
- **updateEvent**: PUT /api/events/:id - Update event (auth + permission required)
- **deleteEvent**: DELETE /api/events/:id - Delete event (auth + permission required)
- **registerForEvent**: POST /api/events/:id/register - Register for event (optional auth)
- **getEventRegistrations**: GET /api/events/:id/registrations - Get registrations (auth required)

### 3. Event Routes (`src/routes/event.ts`)
Configured with proper middleware:
- **Public routes**: Event listing, event details, event registration
- **Protected routes**: Event creation, update, deletion, registration viewing
- **Validation**: All endpoints use Zod validation schemas
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

### 4. Validation Schemas (`src/middleware/validation.ts`)
Extended with event-specific schemas:
- **event.create**: Validation for event creation
- **event.update**: Validation for event updates
- **event.getById**: UUID validation for event ID
- **event.list**: Query parameter validation for filtering and pagination
- **event.register**: Registration form validation
- **event.getRegistrations**: Registration listing validation

### 5. Database Integration
- Uses existing Prisma schema with Content and Event models
- Implements one-to-one relationship between Content and Event
- Handles event registrations with duplicate prevention
- Supports event capacity limits and registration deadlines

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
```
GET    /api/events                    - List events with filtering
GET    /api/events/:id                - Get event details
POST   /api/events/:id/register       - Register for event
```

### Protected Endpoints (Authentication Required)
```
POST   /api/events                    - Create event (EDITOR/ADMIN)
PUT    /api/events/:id                - Update event (EDITOR/ADMIN + permission)
DELETE /api/events/:id                - Delete event (EDITOR/ADMIN + permission)
GET    /api/events/:id/registrations  - Get registrations (EDITOR/ADMIN + permission)
```

## Features Implemented

### Event Management
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for events
- ✅ Event creation with content management integration
- ✅ Event publishing and scheduling
- ✅ Featured image support
- ✅ Event capacity management
- ✅ Registration deadline handling

### Event Filtering and Search
- ✅ Date range filtering (dateFrom, dateTo)
- ✅ Location-based filtering
- ✅ Registration status filtering
- ✅ Full-text search across title and description
- ✅ Pagination support

### Event Registration
- ✅ Guest registration (no authentication required)
- ✅ Member registration (with user association)
- ✅ Registration validation and business rules
- ✅ Duplicate registration prevention
- ✅ Event capacity enforcement
- ✅ Registration deadline enforcement

### Security and Permissions
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Author/Editor/Admin permission checks
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ XSS prevention for event descriptions

### Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error responses
- ✅ Business logic error handling
- ✅ Validation error reporting
- ✅ Database error handling

## Testing
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created (`src/test/event.test.ts`)
- ✅ Tests cover all CRUD operations
- ✅ Tests verify authentication and authorization
- ✅ Tests validate business logic and error handling

## Integration
- ✅ Routes registered in main server (`src/index.ts`)
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ✅ Uses existing middleware and utilities
- ✅ Compatible with existing authentication system

## Requirements Mapping
This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:
- **Requirement 1.3**: Event viewing and registration functionality
- **Requirement 1.4**: Event registration with form submission
- **Requirement 4.1**: Content management system for events
- **Requirement 4.2**: Event creation and management through admin interface

The Event Management API is now fully implemented and ready for use.
